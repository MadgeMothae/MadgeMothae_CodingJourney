# Background and Story: Coffee and Cookie Shop Calculator

## Background
As a beginner programmer, I embarked on a journey to enhance my coding skills by working on practical projects that reflect real-world scenarios. One day, while enjoying a cup of coffee and a delicious cookie at my local café, I noticed how many people were often confused about their total bills, especially when tips and taxes were involved. This sparked an idea: why not create a simple calculator that helps customers easily understand their purchases at a coffee and cookie shop?

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly calculator that allows customers to input their purchases of coffee and cookies, calculate the total cost, and include applicable VAT and tips. By addressing this common problem, I aim to provide a solution that simplifies the checkout process for customers, making their experience more enjoyable and transparent.

### Problem
In many cafés and bakeries, customers often face challenges when trying to calculate the final amount they owe. This can lead to confusion, frustration, and even disputes at the register. Customers may not be aware of the VAT included in their purchases or how much to tip, resulting in an unclear understanding of their total bill.

### Solution
The Coffee and Cookie Shop Calculator is designed to solve this problem by:
Allowing users to input the number of coffees and cookies they wish to purchase.
Calculating the total cost of their selections, including the VAT (15%) and any tips.
Presenting a clear and concise breakdown of the costs, making it easy for customers to see exactly what they are paying for.

### What I Plan to Learn
Through this project, I aim to strengthen my programming skills in several key areas.
#### User Input Handling
Learning how to gather and validate user input effectively.
####Arithmetic Operations
Practising basic mathematical calculations and understanding how to apply them in a real-world context.
#### String Manipulation
Enhancing my ability to format output in a user-friendly manner.
#### Code Organization
Structuring my code for readability and maintainability.
#### Version Control
Gaining experience with Git and GitHub by documenting my progress and sharing my work with others.

### Conclusion
This Coffee and Cookie Shop Calculator is not just a coding exercise; it represents my commitment to learning and creating practical solutions that can make everyday tasks easier for people. I hope that by sharing this project on GitHub, I can inspire others to embark on their programming journeys and contribute to the community of learners and creators. Thank you for checking out my project!
